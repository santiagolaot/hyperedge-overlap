# Code scripts

`run-HO-Kuramoto.sh` is the bash script that launches the simulations.

`HO-Kuramoto.c` is the c file with the structured code.

`HO-Kuramoto-utils.h` is the file that complements `HO-Kuramoto.c`, as it contains the functions.

# Input and output folders

The `Hypergraphs` folder locates the input structures, in the format of a list of groups.

The `Results` folder locates the outputs of the run.
