# Abstract

Recent studies have shown that novel collective behaviors emerge in complex systems due to the presence of higher-order interactions. However, how the collective behavior of a system is influenced by the microscopic organization of its higher-order interactions is not fully understood. In this work,  we introduce a way to quantify the overlap among the hyperedges of a higher-order network, and we show that real-world systems exhibit  different levels of intra-order hyperedge overlap. We then study two types of dynamical processes on higher-order networks, namely complex contagion and synchronization, finding that intra-order hyperedge overlap plays a universal role in determining the collective behavior in a variety of systems. Our results demonstrate that the presence of higher-order interactions alone does not guarantee abrupt transitions. Rather, explosivity and bistability require a microscopic organization of the structure with a low value of intra-order hyperedge overlap.
